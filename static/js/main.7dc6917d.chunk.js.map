I imagine relaxing in\n                the sauna and seeing that everybody is comfortable in the\n                silence we are sharing. A few people who are more connected\n                because they are building a new cob house for the last few\n                weeks, a person who is on a road to discovering what is\n                important to them, so spends last days alone in nature,\n                newcomers who arrived last week and are curiously exploring the\n                space.\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                I see our meeting by the fire, under the stars, which starts\n                with having fun and somehow transforms to sharing our family\n                stories which are still hard for us to think about, but somehow\n                it is lighter to think about them in this group. It ends up with\n                singing songs that hadn&#39;t been invented yet, using the\n                melody to express what we feel and connect to the melodies of\n                others. Or a few of us just joined a dinner table, covered with\n                colorful vegetables and a warm baked meal. In one part of the\n                table, there is a sparkling dreaming conversation about an idea\n                of a new workshop that could be organized using the knowledge we\n                already have and gathered in the last months. Maybe circus of\n                mathematicians and constructors? At the other place, somebody\n                shares a story from their youth, from 40 or 50 years back. It is\n                heartwarming and in some way empowering to hear this tale\n                celebrating friendship from so long time ago. And there is a\n                more tranquil corner, close to the bushes, one can see a lake\n                from there and listen to the birds twittering. What about\n                swimming just before the sunset, or maybe a short boat trip?\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"moomin characters play outside\">\n              <img\n                alt=\"countryside road in summer\"\n                className=\"dreaming-picture\"\n                src=\"https://i.ibb.co/sgb9W3m/715fb34c8f8027d2e7c4c7a4938acbc2.jpg\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <h5>\n              <span>Pain, acceptance, space</span>\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                I remember somebody just lost their mother, and some hearts are\n                broken for many reasons. If it happens to me, I know, by the\n                breakfast table or some other common gathering I find warmth\n                that supports the healing process. I can share the whole story\n                or if the information part is not so important for me - just how\n                I feel now. I can have my space, my behavior differs from how I\n                usually am. I am quieter, less responsive and I get irritated\n                more easily. I know people around me will understand it. I can\n                take my time or share a helpful talk or a boat trip.\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <h5>\n              <span>Conflicts, confusion, connection</span>\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                We have our internal struggles and conflicts. Last time we\n                couldn&#39;t decide what will be the purpose of the new\n                straw-bale house we built. There was some confusion with\n                informal decisions and some power imbalance between people who\n                built it and those who didn&#39;t. We were not sure it should be\n                a children&#39;s house or a new pottery workshop we really need\n                for the upcoming projects and we are not planning to start any\n                new building before wintertime. We use consensus for making\n                decisions and we spent some time talking about our\n                possibilities. It is sometimes hard but afterward usually\n                rewarding. We have conflicts. We may avoid each other for some\n                days but in the end, we know conflicts can bring us closer. It\n                is not a nice experience and sometimes we are really worn. We\n                are learning a lot about others but probably more about\n                ourselves. It helps that we have various life experiences and\n                diverse attitudes towards life. We share values we think are\n                important for our community and learn to live with our\n                differences. We want to appreciate them. Sometimes it is tough\n                to even see why, but when we get to a new choice, concept, based\n                on the mixture of all of our traits it is very gratifying. Or\n                when we understand somebody and learn to appreciate them and in\n                place of an itchy confusion arises that warm glowing sensation.\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"moomin characters play outside\">\n              <img\n                alt=\"countryside road in summer\"\n                className=\"dreaming-picture\"\n                src=\"https://i.ibb.co/LJWDsLy/Moomin-by-Tove-Jansson.jpg\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n\n            <h5>\n              <span>Beauty, cooperation, joy, freedom</span>\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                {\" \"}\n                I also see beautiful workshops. For curiosity, freedom,\n                creativity, dreaming. Careful design, serving as well the\n                pleasure of looking at them, as a convenience and easy\n                navigation between all of the tools. It is soothing to look at\n                people working there, sometimes inspiring and motivating.\n                Sometimes somebody needs help and it is a particular opportunity\n                to learn or have fun together. It is more comfortable and faster\n                to start building something from wood or go back to a\n                not-finished painting that is drying there. There is a group of\n                kids building a piece of furniture for their new house. There is\n                a group of people studying wood joints to use for assembling a\n                treehouse. It looks like a school from dreams. We are from 1 to\n                100 years old, we can use each place and what is maybe more\n                important, if we don&#39;t like some subject, we don&#39;t have\n                to work on it, we may not visit the workshop once. And we see\n                each other failing frequently and leaving the area or trying\n                again. And we see it is ok to fail, it is a part of the process.\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <h5>\n              <span>Nature, books, neighbors, change</span>\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                In the workshops but also in the other areas, an orchard,\n                garden, on the grass fields or by the forest, or in the\n                naturally built houses are happening projects connecting us with\n                our local surroundings and bigger world. We are running a free\n                cafe library. Often we organize natural building and\n                permaculture classes and also workshops on topics as\n                &quot;activist regeneration&quot;, &quot;authenticity&quot; and\n                some dance seminars. Some of us would like to start a workshop\n                for building tiny houses with the use of recycled materials.\n                Some of us are designing children&#39;s books. We are\n                brainstorming about inventing ways to encourage people to build\n                more communities. Documentaries based on interviews with\n                activists from around the world are made. Some of us take a rest\n                after occupying forest or factory. Maybe we can start a new\n                movement? Or create a new cool lamp or book.\n              </span>\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"dreaming-picture-container\">\n              <img\n                alt=\"countryside road in summer\"\n                className=\"dreaming-picture\"\n                src=\"https://i.ibb.co/0QBmzQC/pexels-maria-orlova-4946439.jpg\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n            <h5>\n              <span>Calmness, listening, harmony</span>\n            </h5>\n            <p>\n              <span>\n                And there are trips to the forest to collect blueberries or\n                herbs.
