                  <strong>Notes: </strong> I am not sure how much time the
                  meeting will take. It depends of the amount of people. So if
                  you think you need time to find the answer to those questions,
                  please think about them before meeting so we will minimize
                  thinking/waiting time.{" "}

                  Because length of the meeting depends of the amount of people,
                  we can skip some points of agenda and move them to the next
                  meeting so we fit in 2h. In that case I would suggest skipping
                  points 4 and 5.{" "}
