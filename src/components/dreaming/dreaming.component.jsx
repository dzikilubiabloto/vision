                When I think about a community I would like to be a part of, the
                one I would like to build with other people, the first things I
                feel are calmness, softness, and safety. I imagine relaxing in
                the sauna and seeing that everybody is comfortable in the
                silence we are sharing. A few people who are more connected
                because they are building a new cob house for the last few
                weeks, a person who is on a road to discovering what is
                important to them, so spends last days alone in nature,
                newcomers who arrived last week and are curiously exploring the
                space.

            <p>
              <span>
                I see our meeting by the fire, under the stars, which starts
                with having fun and somehow transforms to sharing our family
                stories which are still hard for us to think about, but somehow
                it is lighter to think about them in this group. It ends up with
                singing songs that hadn&#39;t been invented yet, using the
                melody to express what we feel and connect to the melodies of
                others. Or a few of us just joined a dinner table, covered with
                colorful vegetables and a warm baked meal. In one part of the
                table, there is a sparkling dreaming conversation about an idea
                of a new workshop that could be organized using the knowledge we
                already have and gathered in the last months. Maybe circus of
                mathematicians and constructors? At the other place, somebody
                shares a story from their youth, from 40 or 50 years back. It is
                heartwarming and in some way empowering to hear this tale
                celebrating friendship from so long time ago. And there is a
                more tranquil corner, close to the bushes, one can see a lake
                from there and listen to the birds twittering. What about
                swimming just before the sunset, or maybe a short boat trip?

                I remember somebody just lost their mother, and some hearts are
                broken for many reasons. If it happens to me, I know, by the
                breakfast table or some other common gathering I find warmth
                that supports the healing process. I can share the whole story
                or if the information part is not so important for me - just how
                I feel now. I can have my space, my behavior differs from how I
                usually am. I am quieter, less responsive and I get irritated
                more easily. I know people around me will understand it. I can
                take my time or share a helpful talk or a boat trip.

                We have our internal struggles and conflicts. Last time we
                couldn&#39;t decide what will be the purpose of the new
                straw-bale house we built. There was some confusion with
                informal decisions and some power imbalance between people who
                built it and those who didn&#39;t. We were not sure it should be
                a children&#39;s house or a new pottery workshop we really need
                for the upcoming projects and we are not planning to start any
                new building before wintertime. We use consensus for making
                decisions and we spent some time talking about our
                possibilities. It is sometimes hard but afterward usually
                rewarding. We have conflicts. We may avoid each other for some
                days but in the end, we know conflicts can bring us closer. It
                is not a nice experience and sometimes we are really worn. We
                are learning a lot about others but probably more about
                ourselves. It helps that we have various life experiences and
                diverse attitudes towards life. We share values we think are
                important for our community and learn to live with our
                differences. We want to appreciate them. Sometimes it is tough
                to even see why, but when we get to a new choice, concept, based
                on the mixture of all of our traits it is very gratifying. Or
                when we understand somebody and learn to appreciate them and in
                place of an itchy confusion arises that warm glowing sensation.

                I also see beautiful workshops. For curiosity, freedom,
                creativity, dreaming. Careful design, serving as well the
                pleasure of looking at them, as a convenience and easy
                navigation between all of the tools. It is soothing to look at
                people working there, sometimes inspiring and motivating.
                Sometimes somebody needs help and it is a particular opportunity
                to learn or have fun together. It is more comfortable and faster
                to start building something from wood or go back to a
                not-finished painting that is drying there. There is a group of
                kids building a piece of furniture for their new house. There is
                a group of people studying wood joints to use for assembling a
                treehouse. It looks like a school from dreams. We are from 1 to
                100 years old, we can use each place and what is maybe more
                important, if we don&#39;t like some subject, we don&#39;t have
                to work on it, we may not visit the workshop once. And we see
                each other failing frequently and leaving the area or trying
                again. And we see it is ok to fail, it is a part of the process.

                In the workshops but also in the other areas, an orchard,
                garden, on the grass fields or by the forest, or in the
                naturally built houses are happening projects connecting us with
                our local surroundings and bigger world. We are running a free
                cafe library. Often we organize natural building and
                permaculture classes and also workshops on topics as
                &quot;activist regeneration&quot;, &quot;authenticity&quot; and
                some dance seminars. Some of us would like to start a workshop
                for building tiny houses with the use of recycled materials.
                Some of us are designing children&#39;s books. We are
                brainstorming about inventing ways to encourage people to build
                more communities. Documentaries based on interviews with
                activists from around the world are made. Some of us take a rest
                after occupying forest or factory. Maybe we can start a new
                movement? Or create a new cool lamp or book.

                And there are trips to the forest to collect blueberries or
                herbs. Walks in nature, peaceful evenings in the garden.
                Together, sharing joy or pain, listening, asking for advice or
                presence. In solitude, taking time to calm down the thoughts, to
                get harmony. Sun is setting down, the scent of the evening stock
                is in the air. There is a space for all of it.
