                Place where the spirit of <strong>unschooling</strong> is
                present in giving <strong>freedom</strong> of learning to
                children and encouraging it in adults. Place which is connected
                with the "outside", non community world by being a space that
                encourages <strong>new communities to form</strong> (by sharing
                knowledge or being the first of the new network of communities).
                That would be also a place where ideas grow, projects are built
                and <strong>connections</strong> are created with the local
                surroundings. I would like us to build a
                <strong>safe space</strong> where we can be{" "}

                <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>feel accepted</strong>, to find the ways we can
                appreciate our differences. It would be important to be a real
                community, embracing conflicts and difficult topics, valuing{" "}
                <strong>connection</strong> and <strong>honesty</strong>.
